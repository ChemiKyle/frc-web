First Responder COVID19 Testing Website

###

This repo holds the bootstrap website for frc.ctsi.ufl.edu that is used to navigate first responders (police, fire, EMS, nurses, doctors) to a REDCap survey. The REDCap survey allows first responders to schedule drive up testing for COVID-19.

## Deployment Instructions

Deploying the website content requires that the id_rsa.pub file be added to the authorized_keys files found on the UF IT Apache hosted instance. To connect to the Apache instance ssh cnswww-ctsit.ctsi@glint-prod06.osg.ufl.edu.
